## Getting started
Currently we offer two different versions of sensenet ECM. We recommend version 7.0 for new projects as it is more lightweight and flexible.

### sensenet ECM 7.0
A modern ECM platform that can be integrated into existing or new web applications. We modularized sensenet ECM so that you can install only the parts you need. Take a look at the currently published [core components](/docs/sensenet-components.md)!

There is also a number of other built-in and 3rd party [components and plugins](https://github.com/SenseNet/awesome-sensenet) that are built on this platform either by us or the community.

- [Awesome list of components and plugins](https://github.com/SenseNet/awesome-sensenet)
- [Install sensenet ECM from NuGet](/docs/install-sn-from-nuget.md)

#### After installing sensenet ECM
After you installed [sensenet ECM](/docs/install-sn-from-nuget.md), you can start sending requests to the site. 

Consider using the following client projects to manipulate data in the Content Repository through its REST API:

- [sensenet JavaScript Client](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client-js)
- [sensenet .Net Client](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client-dotnet)

For detailed client side examples, please visit the [REST API article](http://wiki.sensenet.com/OData_REST_API).

### sensenet ECM 6.5
A feature-rich Enterprise CMS with predefined UI and building blocks: pages, portlets, action controls and more. Build your solution with almost no development effort.
