## Sense/Net can be a lot of things

- a development platform
- an internet and intranet portal
- a central Content Repository for all kinds of custom content
- an integration point between your (or your clients') existing applications

Let us know which part you're intrested in most!

## License
Sense/Net is available in two editions:

1. **Community Edition**: a community-supported [GPL v2](LICENSE) edition with almost all the features.
   The source code is available currently on [CodePlex](http://sensenet.codeplex.com), but we'll move it here soon :smiley:.
2. **Enterprise Edition**: with additional enterprise-grade features (like AD sync, MongoDB blob provider) and vendor support! For details, visit the [licencing page](http://www.sensenet.com/sensenet-ecm/licencing) on our site.

## Getting started
Currently we offer two different versions of Sense/Net ECM. We recommend version 7.0 for new projects as it is more lightweight and flexible.
### Sense/Net ECM 7.0 (beta)
A modern ECM platform that can be integrated into existing or new web applications.
- **Sense/Net Services** (the current GitHub repository): a robust Content Repository with enterprise features (security, querying, lists and libraries, dynamic content types), accessible through a REST API, often referred to as a _headless ECMS_.
- a selection of [components and plugins](https://github.com/SenseNet/awesome-sensenet) that are built on this platform.

![Sense/Net Services](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-resources/raw/master/images/sn-components/sn-components_services.png "Sense/Net Services")

Developers may start integrating the Sense/Net platform by installing the **Sense/Net Services NuGet package** into an ASP.NET MVC web application. 

[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/SenseNet.Services.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SenseNet.Services)

1. Create a new ASP.NET web application (using the MVC template, optionally adding Web api or Web Forms), or use an existing one.
2. Install the following NuGet package (either in the Package Manager console or the Manage NuGet Packages window)

`> Install-Package SenseNet.Services -Pre`

3. The install process described in _readme.txt_ will modify the **connection string** in _Web.config_ and _Tools\SnAdminRuntime.exe.config_ files, ensuring that it is pointing to your SQL Server (DataSource) and Database Name (Initial Catalog). The connection string is configured to use _Integrated Security_ by default (this means the Windows account you will use to execute the install tool and later the web application). If you are using **SQL Server authentication** instead of Integrated Security, change Integrated Security to _false_ and add a 'User Id' and 'Password' that will be used to authenticate to the database **in both configuration files** mentioned above. 
````
<connectionStrings>
    <add name="SnCrMsSql" connectionString="Data Source=SQLSERVER;Initial Catalog=sensenet;Integrated Security=false; User Id=test; Password=testpassword" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
</connectionStrings>
````

4. To finalize the install process, please follow the steps described in the [readme file](/src/nuget/readme.txt) of the NuGet package (it opens automatically when you install the package). 
    - You will have to make a few modifications to your config files and Global.asax markup and codebehind file.
    - You will have to compile your solution and **execute a command line tool** that will **create the database** and import the necessary initial content.
    - If you are using the built-in _ActionLink_ helper method in your MVC views, you'll have to replace them with a new extension method added by this package: _MvcActionLink_.

Take into account that currently there is _no UI layer available out of the box_ for Sense/Net ECM 7.0. We are working on moving features available in Sense/Net 6.5 to the new platform. They will be published as NuGet and SnAdmin install packages so that you will be able to build your solution easily using only the components that you truly need.

#### After installing Sense/Net Services
After you added the Sense/Net Services [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SenseNet.Services), you can start sending requests to the site. 

Consider using the following client projects to manipulate data in the Content Repository through its REST API:

- [Sense/Net JavaScript Client](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client-js)
- [Sense/Net .Net Client](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client-dotnet)

Here are a couple of examples for accessing the REST API from native JavaScript, if you prefer that. For detailed examples, please visit the [REST API article](http://wiki.sensenet.com/OData_REST_API).

##### Log in
This is how you can log in from JavaScript using one of the existing users:
````
$.ajax({
     url: "/Odata.svc/('Root')/Login?metadata=no",
     dataType: "json",
     type: 'POST',
     data: JSON.stringify({
          'username': "admin",
          'password': "admin"
     }),
     success: function (d) {
          console.log('You are logged in!')
     }
});
````
The response will contain a standard ASP.NET authentication cookie that your browser will send with subsequent requests automatically.
##### Create content
You can create a workspace under the Root content:
````
$.ajax({
    url: "/OData.svc/('Root')",
    dataType: "json",
    type: 'POST',
    data: "models=[" + JSON.stringify({ '__ContentType':'Workspace' , 'DisplayName': 'Workspace' }) + "]",
    success: function () {
        console.log('Success');
    }
});
````
Create a document library in the workspace:
````
$.ajax({
    url: "/OData.svc/Root/('Workspace')",
    dataType: "json",
    type: 'POST',
    data: "models=[" + JSON.stringify({ '__ContentType':'DocumentLibrary' , 'DisplayName': 'DocLib' }) + "]",
    success: function () {
        console.log('Success');
    }
});
````

### Sense/Net ECM 6.5
A feature-rich Enterprise CMS with predefined UI and building blocks: pages, portlets, action controls and more. Build your solution with almost no development effort.
