### sensenet ECM 7.0
A modern Content Services Platform that can be integrated into existing or new web applications. We modularized sensenet so that you can install only the parts you need. Take a look at the currently published [core components](/docs/sensenet-components.md)!

There is also a number of other built-in and 3rd party [components and plugins](https://github.com/SenseNet/awesome-sensenet) that are built on this platform either by us or the community.

- [Awesome list of components and plugins](https://github.com/SenseNet/awesome-sensenet)
- [Install sensenet from NuGet](/docs/install-sn-from-nuget.md)

#### After installing sensenet
After you installed [sensenet](/docs/install-sn-from-nuget.md), you can start sending requests to the site. 

Consider using the following client projects to manipulate data in the Content Repository through its REST API:

- [sensenet JavaScript Client](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client)
- [sensenet .Net Client](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client-dotnet)

For detailed client side examples, please visit the [REST API article](http://wiki.sensenet.com/OData_REST_API).
