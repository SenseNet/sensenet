A basic setup of sensenet has three top-level parts:

- A content repository that is the storage and service layer
- An application that uses the content of the connected content repository through API calls
- A sensenet admin surface (only in SNaaS) that helps you carry out common content management tasks

## Everything is content
Content is the basic block for storing information in sensenet. A content can be any kind of data, user, document, workspace, memo, task, and more. Using content items everywhere unlocks a great deal of exceptional features, making your experience as a user more seamless, and your job as a developer a lot easier.
