## What is Jamstack?

### According to the official documentation:
- JAMstack is a Modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup.
- When we talk about “The Stack,” we no longer talk about operating systems, specific web servers, backend programming languages, or databases.
- The JAMstack is not about specific technologies. It’s a new way of building websites and apps that delivers better performance, higher security, lower cost of scaling, and a better developer experience.
- JAMstack is a major trend in web development coined by Mathias Biilman, the CEO and co-founder of Netlify.


- JAMstack here stands for
  - JavaScript
  - API
  - Markup

- JAMstack projects don’t rely on server-side code — they can be distributed instead of relying on a server. Served directly from a CDN, JAMstack apps unlock speed, performance and better the user experience.

- Unlike traditional websites or CMS sites that rely heavily on servers, plugins and databases, JAMstack can load some JavaScript that receives data from an API, serving files from a CDN and markup generated using a static site generator during deploy time.
