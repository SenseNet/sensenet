# Smart Application Model

The `Smart Application Model` is a feature of **sensenet ECM** for defining both REST API endpoints and frontend templates to display and manipulate data in the `Content Repository`. It enables portal builders to create a unique look and feel across content items while also saving time.

> Some of the features described in this article (about displaying content with application Pages) are available only if you have the sensenet ECM [WebPages](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-webpages) component installed, but the underlying philosophy of arranging applications, security and url generation applies even if you only have the core [Services layer](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet).

## Basic philosophy

The classic approach in **ASP.NET WebForms** is to create **Forms** (Pages in sensenet ECM) that will aggregate and display data based on their programmed logic. When you enter an address (eg. http://example.com/Default.aspx) into your browser's location bar, it will be the address of a Form. This is pretty straightforward from a programmer's viewpoint. You create logic - web applications - that are explicitly called and executed. However, from a user's viewpoint, nothing can be farther from being straightforward.

Users are usually interested in content items (blogposts, videos, images, etc.), not the logic that can display them. The classic approach seen across the web is to request the desired content in a parameter, usually through the URL query string. This results in URLs like this:

- http://www.example.com/Engine.aspx?board=52&item=4329&mode=show

Such URLs are not friendly to either users or search engines. The most prominent place in the URL - basically, the URL itself - is taken by the application, which should be a quiet servant to the content.

This approach is similar to starting a word processor from the Start Menu, and then opening a document from inside the software. A more intuitive way to work is to find the document you wish to edit, and double-click it. The operating system will automatically load the word processor, and open the document in it. And that is exactly what the **Smart Application Model** does in sensenet ECM.

Here, you have URLs like the following:

- http://www.example.com/MyBlog/2010/08/Great-day

Where "Great-day" is an actual content item (a blog post) located under the path "MyBlog/2010/08/Great-day". Now, somewhere in the system there exists a *Portlet Page*, an ASP.NET application, that will display this blog post. We have simply hidden it from the eyes of the user, and put the content item itself into the lead role.

## Addressing a piece of content

Data in the sensenet ECM Content Repository is stored in a tree model, similar to a file system. Each item has a unique content path through which it can be accessed. However, as a single instance of sensenet ECM can serve several sites with different content, we provide two URL schemes for addressing content items from the web.

### Site relative paths

The most common URLs used in a sensenet ECM installation are site relative, sometimes referred to as friendly URLs. This means exactly what it says. Sites are content items themselves in the sensenet ECM Content Repository, and a relative path points to content that is located inside the site it is accessed from.

For example, let's say we have the following setup:

- Root
  - Sites
    - Exemplar_Cars (http://cars.example.com/)
      - Intro
      - Buy
      - ...
    - Exemplar_Bikes (http://bikes.example.com/)
      - Intro
      - Buy
      - ...
  - Data
    - Prices
      - pricesheet_2009
      - pricesheet_2010

Usually, people will access this repository through one of the sites defined, the **Cars** or the **Bikes** site. Normally whatever follows the domain name in the URL will be the relative path of a content item under the site accessed.

- *http://cars.example.com/Buy* points to */Root/Sites/Exemplar_Cars/Buy*
- *http://bikes.example.com/Buy* points to */Root/Sites/Exemplar_Bikes/Buy*

### Absolute paths

Absolute paths, sometimes also referred to as _"root relative paths"_ are fully qualified paths in the local part of the URL. With absolute paths, you can access content that is not physically located under the site you are logged in to. For a local part to be interpreted as an absolute path, it must start with **/Root**. Usually this is used for administration work, as eg. users and groups, or global resources such as icons and JavaScript frameworks are located outside any of the sites.

> Note that with absolute URLs, one can access a site through the domain name of another site in the sensenet ECM Content Repository.

Examples:

- *http://cars.example.com/Root/Data/Prices/pricesheet_2009* points to */Root/Data/Prices/pricesheet_2009*
- *http://bikes.example.com/Root/Data/Prices/pricesheet_2009* points to */Root/Data/Prices/pricesheet_2009*
- *http://cars.example.com/Root/Sites/Exemplar_Bikes/Buy* points to */Root/Sites/Exemplar_Bikes/Buy*

## Actions

Addressing a content item is only half of the equation, you also need to say what you want to do with it. There are various operations one might execute on a piece of data.

In sensenet ECM, what you want to do with a content item is called an `Action`, and can be passed via the _"action"_ query string parameter:

- http://www.example.com/MyBlog/2010/08/Great_day?action=Edit

If a content item is requested without an action, it is equivalent to specifying the default action, which is **Browse**.

sensenet ECM will load a different application depending on the action specified, therefore you can have a page for displaying a blog post to readers, one for editing it, etc. There is no limitation to the possible number and nature of Actions, so you can, and are encouraged to create entirely custom actions specific to your needs.

Possible actions may, as an example, include:

- http://www.example.com/MyBlog/2010/08?action=NewEntry
- http://www.example.com/MyForum/MyTopic?action=Moderate
- http://www.example.com/StrategyGame/Cloud_Kingdom?action=Attack
- http://www.example.com/Software/Sales?action=Executive-BI-Dashboard

### OData actions
Similarly to Pages (that require the [WebPages](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-webpages) component to be present), OData actions can also be created to extend the REST API of sensenet ECM. They can be defined in the same hierarchy and Content Type structure as old-fashioned Page applications. Follow the links below to learn more about them:

- [Built-in OData actions and functions](built-in-odata-actions-and-functions.md)
- [How to create a custom OData action](how-to-create-a-custom-odata-action.md)

## Application binding

The **Smart Applicaton Model** goes further than just providing a friendly URL scheme. The real power lies in the complex logic that binds applications to content.

In sensenet ECM everything is content and this includes the applications themselves. This means that the applications are located in the [Content Repository](content-repository.md) either as `Portlet Pages` or placeholder content items for logic (like HTTP Handlers) located in a DLL file.

Registering an application means placing it at the right place in the Content Repository, and naming it appropriately.

### Binding by action

The way applications are resolved from the `Action` specified in the URL is as straightforward as it gets. The application needs to be named the same as the Action. Eg. default applications must be called **Browse**, an application for **Edit** actions must be called **Edit**, etc.

### Binding by location

Applications are located in a special `System Folder` called _(apps)_.

There can be an _(apps)_ folder anywhere in the system, and when a content item is requested, the system finds the **closest** _(apps)_ folder and looks at the applications that have been placed there.

If an appropriate application isn't found, the system checks the second closest _(apps)_ folder up in the tree and so on, until an application is found.

### Binding by type

Like an operating system, sensenet ECM also has types. The first layer of the binding logic does the same thing that your favorite OS would do to open the word processor for a document. It finds an application registered for the `Content Type` of the requested item.

In fact, it goes one step further, as sensenet ECM types have *inheritance*. Therefore, if an application isn't found for the type in question, the system will check each of its ancestor types, until a registered app is found.

To registed an application for a specific `Content Type`, you need to place it into a folder named after the type under an _(apps)_ folder. Therefore, the path of a **Browse** application registered for the `HtmlContent` type may look something like this:

- _{ parent path }_/(apps)/**HtmlContent/Browse**


### "This" binding

Similar to binding by type, a set of `Smart Applications` can be defined for a single content item, and that single content item only, by placing the `Smart Applications` into a folder named **This** in the _(apps)_ folder under the content item in question:

- _{ my content item }_/(apps)/**This/Browse**

The `Smart Applications` defined with a **This** binding have absolute priority in the resolution process.

### Seeing it as a whole

Above we have looked at the three components of application binding. However, to work efficiently, you need to understand how they relate to each other.

The simplest part of the process is the action binding. The system will look for an application that is named exactly as the `Action` specified. There are no fallbacks on this, if no application is found, an error message will be returned.

When a request arrives, the system will sequentially probe the _(apps)_ system folders starting from the closest to the content item requested. In each _(apps)_ folder, it will look for a folder that matches the type of the requested content item most closely (so parent content types are also in play!), while containing an application with the same name as the `Action specified`. If not found, it advances on to the next _(apps)_ folder, until a matching application is found, or it becomes apparent that such an application is not present.

**Examples**

See the following, simple content tree:

- MySite
  - (apps)
    - GenericContent
      - Browse
      - Edit
    - BlogPost
      - Browse
  - SpecialSection
    - (apps)
      - GenericContent
        - Browse
    - SpecialBlog
      - Post1 (type: BlogPost)
      - Post2 (type: BlogPost)
  - Blog
    - Post1 (type: BlogPost)
    - Post2 (type: BlogPost)
      - (apps)
        - This
          - Browse
    - Post3 (type: BlogPost)

> Note that all content types in sensenet ECM are derived from `GenericContent`.

Let's have a look at some requests that may arrive, and how the system handles them:

- http://www.example.com/Blog/Post1

Here we have no `Action` specified, which means that the default `Action` will be used, which is **Browse**. This is how the request will be resolved:

1. No _(apps)_ folder found under **Blog**
2. Found _(apps)_ folder under the parent folder **(MySite)**
3. **Browse** application found under the folder **BlogPost**
4. Application used: **/MySite/(apps)/BlogPost/Browse**

- http://www.example.com/Blog/Post2

1. _(apps)_ folder found under **Post2**
2. _This_ folder found under **Post2/(apps)**
3. **Browse** application found under the folder **This**
4. Application used: **/MySite/Blog/Post2/(apps)/This/Browse**

> Note that the Application placed in the _This_ folder under the Content (_Post2_) itself overrides the `Application` used in the case of _Post1_

- http://www.example.com/Blog/Post1?action=Edit

1. No _(apps)_ folder found under **Blog**
2. Found _(apps)_ folder under the parent folder (**MySite**)
3. No **Edit** application found under the folder **BlogPost**
4. Checking folders matching the ancestors of the **BlogPost** type
5. **Edit** application found under the folder **GenericContent**
6. Application used: **/MySite/(apps)/GenericContent/Edit**

- http://www.example.com/SpecialSection/SpecialBlog/Post1

Again, no action specified means **Browse** action.

1. No _(apps)_ folder found under **SpecialBlog**
2. Found _(apps)_ folder under the parent folder (**SpecialSection**)
3. Checking folders matching the ancestors of the **BlogPost** type
4. **Browse** application found under the folder **GenericContent**
5. Application used: **/MySite/SpecialSection/(apps)/GenericContent/Browse**

> Note that though there is a specific **Browse** application for **BlogPosts**, the **GenericContent** application placed in a higher position in the tree overrides it.

- http://www.example.com/SpecialSection/SpecialBlog/Post1?action=Edit

1. No _(apps)_ folder found under **SpecialBlog**
2. Found _(apps)_ folder under the parent folder (**SpecialSection**)
3. No **Edit** application found under any folder matching an ancestor of **BlogPost**. Moving on to next _(apps)_ folder.
4. Found _(apps)_ folder under the parent folder (**MySite**)
5. No **Edit** application found under the folder **BlogPost**
6. Checking folders matching the ancestors of the **BlogPost** type
7. **Edit** application found under the folder **GenericContent**
8. Application used: **/MySite/(apps)/GenericContent/Edit**

## Self-dispatching content

There is a way to override the above mechanism on a single content item. This is possible by setting the **Default Browse Application** field to an executable content item (`Portlet Page`, `Webform`, `HttpHandler`, etc.)

If set, the system will always display the content item using this application in **Browse** mode.

## Pages as content

Before the introduction of the **Smart Application Model**, the preferred building block of `Sites` were `Portlet Pages`. URLs would always point at `Portlet Pages` or downloadable Files, with preset configurations or query string parameters specifying the content item(s) to be displayed.

You must know that this is still an option. `Portlet Pages` can, and in certain circumstances, should, be used as primary content items to be directly addressed by the user. To help you decide when to do this, we have collected some disadvantages of the **Smart Application Model**, and select scenarios when addressing `Portlet Pages` directly may be the best thing to do.

There is, however, a golden middle. By creating a **Browse** Smart Application with "This" binding, you can have the best of both worlds. This comes in especially handy when you need a unique, dashboard-like `Portlet Page` to be displayed on a major container node, such as a `Site` root or a `Workspace`. Simply put, use `Portlet Pages` for leaf content and "This" binding for containers.

### Smart Application Model disadvantages

- The presentations of specific content items aren't readily customizable
- On production systems it may not always be clear which **Smart Application** is used and why
- When making changes to a **Smart Application**, the scope of affected content is not always obvious
- Sometimes the **Smart Application** philosophy does not fit the goal (eg. as with a calculator or online tool of some sort)

### When to use Portlet Pages as primary content

- For stand-alone tools and applications (like the calculator mentioned before)
- For leaf dashboard pages that aggregate content from all around the system (eg. BI dashboards)
- To display content physically outside the `Site` without using an absolute URL
- To display data from external sources (eg. web services)
- When creating an AJAX-heavy browsing experience that encompasses several content items
- When a **Smart Application** is unlikely to ever be invoked for more than one single content item

## Permissions

The applications accessible to the user depends on permissions set on the applications and on the content itself. For more details on which permissions you should set on the applications and on the content, please visit the following article:
