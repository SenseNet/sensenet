# Field Setting

The FieldSetting object is the implementation of the configuration element in a [Content Type Definition](ctd.md). Every field has a FieldSetting object.

The FieldSetting object can be accessed via a property on every field:

```csharp
var fs = myField.FieldSetting;
```

## Field and FieldSetting

The FieldSetting is an important extensibility point in the sensenet [Content Repository](content-repository.md). While the Field implements the usable .NET data type, the FieldSetting describes the type of the information stored in a semantic way. For example the IntegerField uses the System.Int32 type which is a technical type, whereas the IntegerFieldSetting can specify that the field's value must be between 1 and 80, which makes the field more suitable for storing lottery numbers.

## Default FieldSetting for a Field

Every field type has a default FieldSetting type, that is declared on the field implementation with the DefaultFieldSettingAttribute:

```csharp
[DefaultFieldSetting(typeof(ShortTextFieldSetting))]
public class ShortTextField : Field
```

## FieldSetting declaration in CTD

To define a specific FieldSetting implementation for a field, use the handler attribute of the Configuration element in the CTD providing the fully qualified name of the desired FieldSetting type:

```xml
<Field name="Email" type="ShortText">
  <Configuration handler="SenseNet.ContentRepository.Fields.ActivationFieldSetting">
    <Enabled>true</Enabled>
    <MailFrom></MailFrom>
    <MailDefinition>
      Click the following link to activate your account:
      ##ActivationLink##
    </MailDefinition>
    <MailSubject>Activation subject</MailSubject>
    <IsBodyHtml>false</IsBodyHtml>
    <MailPriority>Low</MailPriority>
  </Configuration>
</Field>
```

In this case the type of the field is *ShortText*, however we use the *ActivationFieldSetting* type instead of the more general *ShortTextFieldSetting* type. As you see the contents of the *Configuration* element depend on the used FieldSetting type.

## Built-in FieldSettings

The following diagram shows the built-in field types of sensenet:

## Common configuration elements

For a list and description of common configuration elements please refer to the following article:

- [Content Type Definition](ctd.md#Field-definition)

## Validation mechanism

The FieldSetting not only specifies the type of information but it also validates according to its implementation. Validation can happen automatically on saving a content, or manually from code. The Field is able to store the validation status (valid, invalid, reason of error), thus if a validation has occurred the field will be revalidated if its data has changed or a previous validation has failed. 

When developing user interaction we don't come across the validation mechanism, since it is done in the background. There are some properties however that indicate if a validation has failed or not. The following code snippet is an example for handling validation:

```csharp
if (content.IsValid)
{
    try
    {
        content.Save();
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Logger.WriteException(ex);
        contentView.ContentException = ex;
    }
}
```

When a content view updates the underlying content all fields are validated by their field settings and the view's controls can access the validation results. If there is a problem with any field data the content's *IsValid* property will be set to false and the view will be able to display the validation details.
